# Implementation of Custom Data Type in PostgreSQL
- Created the PersonName data type in PostgreSQL using C, enhancing the database's ability to manage names with a structured format by separating family and given names for accurate querying.
- Developed and integrated several SQL and C functions for data input/output, comparison operations, and formatting, ensuring seamless functionality and compatibility with PostgreSQL's system.
- Implemented indexing on the PersonName type to boost query performance, especially for extensive datasets. Utilised PostgreSQL indexing techniques to optimise data retrieval.
